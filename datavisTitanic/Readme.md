This is my code for the Titanic exercise for module 4 - Exploratory Data Analysis

To answer the question how likely am I to survive, I would give myself really good odds. 

In the code, I created several charts as instructed: 
bar chart to show numbers of males and females in each class
then split the bar charts via a facet grid into those who survived and those who didn't
then turned that split chart into a scatter plot with jittering
I also did a simple histogram myself of sex with survival as the colour to see quickly how chances were split simply between male and female without factoring in other variables.

After doing the exercise (and my simple chart of surviving if female) it seems being a woman is the biggest thing working in my favour before the other variables. 

Pclass wise, my chances of dying go right down if I was in second or first. As a married middle class woman, I would probably have afforded myself the second class ticket. 

My age is not optimal - if I were under 21 I would have had a very small chance of not surviving as shown by the singular dot on the jittered plot (assuming I am not in third class).

However even at 37, I'm doing ok as there is a weird gap in those who don't survive and are female (of all classes) at around that age. 

So I would conclude that there's a high probability that I would have survived.
