This is the second machine learning exercise for Springboard intro to data science course. 

There's no plots or charts as outputs of the exercise so I have just included the R script as a submission within this folder.

I have annotated the code with some comments on what I have done and also on the final outputs of the model that
predicts the likelyhood that someone has ever been in work based on their marital status. 

Please note, as part of the exercise, there was code to install a package called effects
I tried to install this several times on different machines but it just kept crashing
