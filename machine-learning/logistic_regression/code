## Regression with binary outcomes
## ═════════════════════════════════

## Logistic regression
## ───────────────────────

##   This far we have used the `lm' function to fit our regression models.
##   `lm' is great, but limited–in particular it only fits models for
##   continuous dependent variables. For categorical dependent variables we
##   can use the `glm()' function.

##   For these models we will use a different dataset, drawn from the
##   National Health Interview Survey. From the [CDC website]:

##         The National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) has monitored
##         the health of the nation since 1957. NHIS data on a broad
##         range of health topics are collected through personal
##         household interviews. For over 50 years, the U.S. Census
##         Bureau has been the data collection agent for the National
##         Health Interview Survey. Survey results have been
##         instrumental in providing data to track health status,
##         health care access, and progress toward achieving national
##         health objectives.

##   Load the National Health Interview Survey data:
setwd("~/Desktop/logistic_regression")
NH11 <- readRDS("dataSets/NatHealth2011.rds")
labs <- attributes(NH11)$labels

## Logistic regression example
## ───────────────────────────────

##   Let's predict the probability of being diagnosed with hypertension
##   based on age, sex, sleep, and bmi

str(NH11$hypev) # check stucture of hypev
levels(NH11$hypev) # check levels of hypev
# collapse all missing values to NA
NH11$hypev <- factor(NH11$hypev, levels=c("2 No", "1 Yes"))
# run our regression model
hyp.out <- glm(hypev~age_p+sex+sleep+bmi,
              data=NH11, family="binomial")
coef(summary(hyp.out))

## Logistic regression coefficients
## ────────────────────────────────────

##   Generalized linear models use link functions, so raw coefficients are
##   difficult to interpret. For example, the age coefficient of .06 in the
##   previous model tells us that for every one unit increase in age, the
##   log odds of hypertension diagnosis increases by 0.06. Since most of us
##   are not used to thinking in log odds this is not too helpful!

##   One solution is to transform the coefficients to make them easier to
##   interpret

hyp.out.tab <- coef(summary(hyp.out))
hyp.out.tab[, "Estimate"] <- exp(coef(hyp.out)) #Turn the Estimate column from a log no into a no.
hyp.out.tab

## Generating predicted values
## ───────────────────────────────

##   In addition to transforming the log-odds produced by `glm' to odds, we
##   can use the `predict()' function to make direct statements about the
##   predictors in our model. For example, we can ask "How much more likely
##   is a 63 year old female to have hypertension compared to a 33 year old
##   female?".

# Create a dataset with predictors set at desired levels
predDat <- with(NH11,
                expand.grid(age_p = c(33, 63),
                            sex = "2 Female",
                            bmi = mean(bmi, na.rm = TRUE),
                            sleep = mean(sleep, na.rm = TRUE)))
# predict hypertension at those levels
cbind(predDat, predict(hyp.out, type = "response",
                       se.fit = TRUE, interval="confidence",
                       newdata = predDat))

##   This tells us that a 33 year old female has a 13% probability of
##   having been diagnosed with hypertension, while and 63 year old female
##   has a 48% probability of having been diagnosed.

## Packages for  computing and graphing predicted values
## ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

##   Instead of doing all this ourselves, we can use the effects package to
##   compute quantities of interest for us (cf. the Zelig package).

install.packages("effects", dependencies=TRUE)
library(effects)
plot(allEffects(hyp.out))


## please note that I have tried to install the effects package on two different laptops and it doesn't seem to work. 

## Exercise: logistic regression
## ───────────────────────────────────

##   Use the NH11 data set that we loaded earlier.

##   1. Use glm to conduct a logistic regression to predict ever worked
##      (everwrk) using age (age_p) and marital status (r_maritl).

str(NH11$everwrk) # check stucture of everwk
levels(NH11$everwrk) # check levels of everwk
str(NH11$r_maritl) # check stucture of r_maritl
levels(NH11$r_maritl) # check levels of r_maritl


NH11$everwrk <- factor(NH11$everwrk, levels=c("2 No", "1 Yes")) #Turn ever worked into only 2 level factor in order to run model
NH11$r_maritl <- factor(NH11$r_maritl, levels=c("8 living with partner", "7 Never married", "6 Separated", "5 Divorced", "4Widowed", "3 Married - spouse in household unknown", "2 Married - spouse not in household", "1 Married - spouse in household", "0 Under 14 years"))
#Also turn r_maritl into a factor in order to run model


everwrk.out <- glm(everwrk~age_p+r_maritl,  # create the logistic regression model
    data=NH11, family="binomial") 
coef(summary(everwrk.out)) #examine coefficients

#Convert the outputs to non log numbers to interpret

everwrk.out.tab <- coef(summary(everwrk.out))
everwrk.out.tab[, "Estimate"] <- exp(coef(everwrk.out))
everwrk.out.tab

##   2. Predict the probability of working for each level of marital
##      status.

##  Create a dataset with predictors set at desired levels of marital status
predeverwrk <- with(NH11,
                expand.grid(r_maritl = c("6 Separated", "5 Divorced", "2 Married - spouse not in household", "1 Married - spouse in household")))
# I chose these levels because they are the only ones that appear in the outputs of the model

#predict ever worked at those levels
everwrk.out1 <- glm(everwrk~r_maritl,  #logistic regression model 
                  data=NH11, family="binomial")
coef(summary(everwrk.out1))

cbind(predeverwrk, predict(everwrk.out1, type = "response",
                       se.fit = TRUE, interval="confidence",
                       newdata = predeverwrk))

##   Model shows that there is a high chance that all people with one of those 4 marital statuses have worked
##   Separated 88%, Divorced 94%, Married, spouse not in household 88% and Married, spouse in household 89%
##   One could conclude that the more likely you are to be in work, the higher chance of divorce! Perhaps divorce driven by a partner working too hard.....

##   Note that the data is not perfectly clean and ready to be modeled. You
##   will need to clean up at least some of the variables before fitting
##   the model.
