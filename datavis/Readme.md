Second GGPLOT exercise - investigating the California Health Interview Survey dataset from 2009.

The first section of the code investigates the variables BMI and age so anomolies (such as abnormally high or low BMI and counting anyone over 85 as 85) can be removed.

Then various plots are used to look at the relationship between age and BMI as a category (Under-weight, Normal-weight, Overweight and Obese).
