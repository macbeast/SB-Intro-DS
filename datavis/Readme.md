Second GGPLOT exercise - investigating the California Health Interview Survey dataset from 2009.

The first section of the code investigates the variables BMI and age so anomolies (such as abnormally high or low BMI and counting anyone over 85 as 85) can be removed.

Then various plots are used to look at the relationship between age and BMI as a category (Under-weight, Normal-weight, Overweight and Obese). This includes using denisty rather than count. 

The second section led me through creating a mosaic plot - which is more informative than the histograms in the first section. A mosaic uses a rectangle to represent each of the four categories of BMI in each of the age groups rather than just one bar per age group. This is useful as you can then start to colour each bar to show where the data is diverging from normal trends. This is what the last charts do. 

The whole process is then stored as a function that can then be applied to any dataset! Which could be a very handy tool!
