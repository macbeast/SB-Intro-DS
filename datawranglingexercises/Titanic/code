#Firstly, examine the data frame

#Replace blank ports of embarkation with "S" - embarked is a factor with 4 levels and the emply ones are ""
titanic_raw$embarked_replace <- (gsub(pattern = "^$", replacement = "S", x = titanic_raw$embarked))

#Replace missing ages with the mean age
#The below works but is not very elegant - is there not a way to use mutate funciton to create new column and replace NA with 30?

titanic_raw$age_with_mean <- titanic_raw$age
titanic_raw$age_with_mean[is.na(titanic_raw$age)] <- mean(x = titanic_raw$age, na.rm = TRUE)

#Other ways to replace the mean - median? Mode? Mean of different groups? The first two would be misleading but there may be some merit in finding the mean of subgroups to give a more accurate representation of the missing ages. 

#Replace blank values in the boat column with "NA"

titanic_raw$boat_with_NA <- (gsub(pattern = "^$", replacement = NA, x = titanic_raw$boat))

#Create a new column that has 1 if the person has a cabin number and 0 if not 
#I am going to create an ifelse statement to count whether or not there are any charaters in cabin number. 
#So I have to turn the cabin column into a column of characters rather than factors
#The question of what a missing cabin number means and whether it's worth replacing the blank slots. I would say it's misleading to replace the cabin numbers. There's no easy way to find a mean number here. 
#Additionally, the absence of a cabin number may indiacate someone in a lower class of berth (ie not in a cabin) which may correlate to survival rates (ie if someone has a number they were more likely to survive)
#So if you replaced blank cabin numbers with a value, you would lose the ability to check if having a cabin number impacts chance of survival

titanic_raw$cabin_number_char <- as.character(titanic_raw$cabin)

#Then create an ifelse statement that assigns a zero if ther are no characters and a one if there are one or more

titanic_raw$has_cabin_number <- ifelse(nchar(titanic_raw$cabin_number_char), 1, 0)

#Finally, write to a clean csv file for submission

titanic_clean <- titanic_raw
write.csv(titanic_clean, 'titanic_clean.csv')
