First exercise in the Springboard data wrangling module. 

I imported the raw csv as refine_originalmac

The code I have used to complete the exercises is included in one document. 

The resulting clean data that I created was written to a new csv file which is available as refine_clean.csv.

I did find myself using techniques outside of the course materials, with the help of Stack Overflow! The most useful thing in my opinion was installing dummies. Reduced my original method of creating dummy variables from a line of code per unique value (4 each time) to just one line of code. 

It was pretty painful going - I will not lie - BUT what a great way to learn and test all the things that I have done.
